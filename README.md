# My Life in Months

**This visualization was inspired by [Isabella Benabaye](https://isabella-b.com/blog/my-life-in-months/).**

This is a waffle chart of each month in my life until age 100 (I am being optimistic here!). It includes a number of major life events.

This chart was made with `R`, specifically [`waffle::geom_waffle`](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/waffle). It was then finalized in Adobe Illustrator.
